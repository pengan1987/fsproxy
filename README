Operation:

FSP Proxy runs on port by default 9090 and accepts fsp://*, http://*, ftp://*
and gopher://* URLs on input side. There requests are transformed info FSP v2
requests and sent to the target FSP server.  Most browser do not recognize
fsp:// urls, so you have to type gopher: instead of fsp:

Simply type in browser ` gopher://your.favourite.fsp.site/ ` and begin...
In most cases you must use port number as part of URL:
   gopher://your.favourite.fsp.site:2000/

Directory listings are pretty fast, isn't it?
