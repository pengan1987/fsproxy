This program needs correctly installed (in CLASSPATH) jfsplib,
you can get it from main FSP protocol suite site:
http://fsp.sourceforge.net/javalib.html

2. Setup WWW browser's proxy
Setup Gopher proxy in web browser to port 9090 on host which is running
fsproxy.

3. Run fsp proxy daemon

Running:
Usage: java -jar fsproxy-X.Y.jar [portnumber] [mime type table]

FSP proxy can load mime.types style file for mapping file extensions
to mime types. You can get this file from apache httpd distribution.

Example: java -jar fsproxy-0.8.jar 9090 /usr/local/etc/mime.types

~/sf/fsproxy% java -jar fsproxy-0.8.jar
Sat Oct 30 12:29:23 CEST 2009 FSP Proxy 0.8 ready on 9090/*

Operation:

FSP Proxy runs on port by default 9090 and accepts fsp://*, http://*, ftp://*
and gopher://* URLs on input side. These requests are transformed info FSP v2
requests and sent to the target FSP server.  Most browser do not recognize
fsp:// urls, so you have to type gopher: instead of fsp:

Simply type in your browser URL bar 'gopher://your.favourite.fsp.site/' without
quotes and begin to browse content of particular FSP site.
In most cases you must use port number as part of URL:
   gopher://your.favourite.fsp.site:2000/

Directory listing is pretty fast, isn't it?
